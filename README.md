# The Soothsayer and the Carpenter

This was originally a game for the [js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com/), but the version submitted was very unfinnished, 
but I kinda liked it and felt it had more potential so I'm gonna finnish it. 

The game plot:
Help guide the spirit of a dying young boy through deaths labyrinth back to life before the light goes out. 
Gems will renew the strength of the light. There are hidden switches that alters the maze and sometimes the maze changes by itself.

Support for gamepad and keyboard, arrows and w,s,a,d

There's a Map Editor in here that was used for making the levels, its very rough but I intend to make it smoother, that way you can make your own levels and share your version of the game with friends if you want to. It's a work in progress
